-- A. Customer Journey
-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- In this query, I retrieved 3 customer_ids to display their onboarding journey.
-- Customer 1 started the free trial on 1 Aug 2020 and subsequently subscribed to the basic monthly plan on 8 Aug 2020 after the 7-days trial has ended.
-- Customer 2 started the free trial on 20 Sep 2020 and subsequently subscribed to the pro annual plan on 27 Sep 2020 after the 7-days trial has ended.
-- Customer 4 started the free trial on 17 Jan 2020 and subsequently subscribed to the basic monthly plan on 24 Jan 2020 after the 7-days trial has ended. This customer eventually churn out on 21 Apr 2021.
